This started off as the portfolio project from @freecodecamp and has generated into me building up a portfolio and will 
consist as it grows some examples of my work and details about myself and how to contact me.

I welcome all feedback on my code on how I can improve it so please do raise issues if there is anything that you can help with.

Thanks,
Mike.
